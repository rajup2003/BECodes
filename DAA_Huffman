# Space Complexity
#Priority Queue (Heap):
#The priority queue is used to store HuffmanNode objects based on their frequencies.
#In the worst case, it can contain all the unique characters, so its space complexity 
#is O(n), where n is the number of unique characters.
#HuffmanNode Objects:
#For each character, a HuffmanNode object is created to store its frequency and character.
#In the worst case, there will be n unique characters, so the space complexity for these objects is O(n).
#Additional Variables:
#Other variables such as charArray and charfreq store the input characters and their frequencies. 
#These arrays have space complexity of O(n) where n is the number of unique characters.
#Considering these factors, the overall space complexity of the given Huffman coding implementation is O(n),

#Time Complexity
#Constructing the Priority Queue (Heap):
#Creating a priority queue and inserting n elements into it takes O(n * log(n)) time, 
#where n is the number of unique characters. Each insertion operation takes log(n) time in the worst case.
#Building the Huffman Tree:
#Extracting minimum elements from the priority queue and merging them to create the Huffman tree takes
# O(n * log(n)) time. This operation is repeated (n - 1) times because a Huffman tree with n nodes has (n - 1) internal nodes.
#Within each iteration, extracting two minimum elements and inserting one merged element back into 
# the priority queue takes O(log(n)) time. This step is repeated (n - 1) times.
#Printing Huffman Codes:
#Printing the Huffman codes involves traversing the Huffman tree, which takes O(n) time. 
# This is because every character in the input is represented by a leaf node in the Huffman tree.
#Considering these factors, the overall time complexity of the given Huffman coding implementation is O(n * log(n)).
